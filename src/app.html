  <!--Apparently to create the kinds of child controls like this footer here
  You need to include the js file which has the class in it.  Otherwise the bindings won't work, and it will just insert it as
  raw html.  To debug this stuff setup the control with a real route, and put it into the menu.  When you click on that route, it will load
  the control, and you'll better be able to diagnose what's going on with it.  Also notice it's included in the html below.
  I will also say it seems like you're not allowed to capitalize this stuff.  No idea why, but that seems to be why renaming was so hard.
