    <h1>Prague Fashion Photographer</h1>
    <p>
        I've been a photographer since I was just a little boy, and I have to say it's been one of the most rewarding things I've
        ever done with my life. I couldn't be happier taking interesting pictures, and making my clients look amazing. Initially
        when I started doing photography I shot engagements and portraits. Then soon I moved on to shoot weddings. My very
        first fashion shoot was with one of my close friends. I always thought that interesting people made for interesting
        pictures. It turns out that was only half the case, and I quickly realized I simply wasn't good enough to shoot fashion
        photography. That's when I started delving more and more into weddings and engagements.  I always dreamed of shooting as 
        a <b>prague fashion photographer</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While those were satisfying for quite some time. I really didn't like how stressed out they made me. When you're responsible
        for someones big day it's imperitive that you make it work. Which can certainly be challenging, but it can also be
        very satisfying. After a while of doing that I realized that I really wanted to move into more creative works. I
        just didn't seem to feel like I had enough creative freedom. I really wanted to like shooting those kinds of things,
        but in the end it just wasn't for me. I ended up assisting on one of those shoots a few years ago, and realized yet
        again that it just wasn't for me. I think there's part of me that's a bit jealous of my photographer buddies who
        can shot that kind of work. I know it's lucrative, and I really want to enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a while, and a few weddings that went south on me, because of who I was working with, I decided it was time for me
        to get back into fashion. Which is where my true passion lies. The best part about fashion is that you can shoot
        anything you want. Whatever is in your head, whatever inspires you, there's someone who has at least attempted it
        before. I learned quickly that I had a penchant for lighting. Lighting is the core comptency for me. I'm great at
        figuring out how something was lit. I'm not quite as good at posing models, although I can certainly do it, but lighting
        is where my talent really shines. I actually keep a small notebook that's filled with all my lighting setups, and
        I refer back to it whenever I need to get inspiration, or if a client comes in and wants something exactly out of
        my portfolio. I actually value my notebooks quite highly. It's actually really fun to be able to look back on them
        from time to time even just as a journal of my photography. It's fun to see when I got my first studio, or when I
        had my first fashion editorial published. Those are memories that I can't imagine what I would do without them.
    </p>
    <h2>Commercial Photography</h2>
    <p>
        Well it's certainly been a crazy ride on this whole photography thing. My first client was a building downtown. Now while
        I was only tasked with taking pictures of the building, I learned early on that pleasing your client is of utmost
        importance. I took that first commercial gig as an opportunity to wow my client. I gave them shots that went above
        and beyond what they asked for. Initially they just wanted images that captured the building, but I took the time
        to stay late, and get really amazing images with a long shutter at night. This gave them a modern feel, and captured
        a bit of that city aspect. That's what I love about photography something can change so drastically from moment to
        moment. Sunlit, or at night, it's wildly different.
    </p>
    <h2>Portraits</h2>
    <p>
        After that first client, I started taking portraits, and that's where I truly fell in love. I loved hearing peoples stories,
        and trying to capture those on film. It's not an easy task, or one that I take lightly. It can take a few moments
        to get to know someone or a whole session. Either way it's a valuable part of any shoot. Learning about the person
        allows you to capture something deeper in their person. It allows you to peer past whatever shell they have up, and
        capture that inner person.  These days my work is certainly moving more towards editorial portraits, which are done
        more for a magazine and less for the individual person.  It's critical for me that I do try and capture something of their personality 
        in them though.  That's where my talents for portraits come into play.  Because I know that I can interact with someone on
        a very human level, I know that I can try and pull out very interesting things about them. 
    </p>
    <h2>Corprate Headshots</h2>
    <p>
        Then I started getting more business clients. People who wanted head shots for their linkedin profile. Really interesting
        people. Some of them are just moving up, some of them have been at the top for years. It's always interesting seeing
        the different personalities that come when you've been running major companies. Sometimes shy in front of the camera,
        sometimes gruff, sometimes warmer than you would think. See what I mean I love hearing peoples stories. You can check
        out my commercial photography work here. I've always actually loved having these kinds of business clients. They
        can turn out to be great contacts, combined with the fact that they're just generally cool and interesting people.
        I've shot everyone from CEO's to CFO's, and oil tycoons and everything in between. I do actually really love taking
        someone who doesn't think they're very good in front of a camera, and taking a beautiful photograph of them, and
        showing them how awesome they can truly be. These people are my bread and butter. They work very hard at their jobs,
        and I get to show off their best side. I've been doing headshots since I can remember, and I couldn't imagine a better
        way to interact with people around town.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also work with major corporations and brands creating the iconic images you see on major magazines. I can put together
        a shoot that will make your publication truly stand out. These will give you a better idea of the many
        styles that I can shoot. You'll see everything from actor shots to major brand CEO and executive portraits.
    </p>
    <h2>Fashion Photography</h2>
    <p>
        Last up was Fashion. My love. My one true love. Oh if I could just shoot fashion all day that would make me happy. I can't
        imagine a world where I'm not shooting fashion. It's really where my passion lies. Fashion allows me to still shoot
        characters, only their my characters. They're the characters that I dream up. In clothes that I pick, and models
        that I pick, lighting that I choose, backdrops, post. It's all in my control. Whatever story I want to tell that
        week I can tell it. I still get to meet people, and interact with them, but at the end of the day it's my vision.
        It's the vision I create that will be the final image. Now I still need to keep my client in mind, but they hired
        me because they want me to produce my vision in a new incarnation. That's a powerful endorsement. We like what you've
        done creatively so do it again! That's awesome, and anytime I book a fashion client it feels like approval of what
        I'm doing with my work.
    </p>
    <h2>Editorial Photography</h2>
    <p>
        I have to say when I first started I didn't think I'd ever be an editorial photographer, but as time went on I wanted to
        shoot more editorials. They are so interesting to me, because you have a chance to tell a story with your images.
        At first I have to say I didn't have many stories to tell, but over time, I realized that I was telling a story,
        I just wasn't putting them into editorials like I should be. After a while i realized that I should work on more.
        I started off working with just one model on a simple editorial about light. She was so great at moving that I knew
        that I had to capture her movement. From there it's been a rollercoaster of editorials. I created one that was the
        story of two runaways. Something that I always had in my head, initially though I simply didn't have the talent to
        pull off the shot that I had in my head. Once I had the talent though it was game over. Since then I've done all
        sorts of different editorials. Ones on film that I developed myself to spreads for major magazines. And while those
        spreads are wildly nerve racking they certainly do push me into new and uncharted territory. These shoots teach me
        that I still have a lot to learn with my photography and lots of new stories to tell with my photography. Something
        I'm super excited to be doing.
    </p>
    <h2>Prague Editorial Portrait Photographer</h2>
    <p>
        Honestly, some of my favorite shoot have been editorial portraiture.  There's something special about taking input 
        from the creative director, and then translating that for a client into an amazing image.  It's always a pretty big challenge
        to take what you get from the director and push the subject to give you a truly amazing shot.  A lot of the time 
        the subject is someone famous so working with them can be tricky.  They might have a large crew of people following 
        them around, and they might have an ego to match.  Although, to be honest I've always felt like shooting weddings 
        prepared me for the pressure that's invovled in directing these kinds of shoots.  My favorite one so far was when I shot
        Lindsay Vonn for Rhapsody magazine.  That shoot started off a little rough.  I really thought Lindsay was going to be 
        super cold, but luckily once we got into the middle of the shoot, she opened up.  I think she appreciated the fact that
        I was joking with her, and being more sarcastic than all of her people that were following her around.  I think it plays
        into the fact that I don't really act any different if my client is a famous celebrity or a local real estate agent.  I try
        and treat everone with the same humor and realism.  I think when you start putting on a front it comes out, and people see
        right through it.  I don't ever want someone to feel like I haven't been real with them.  
    </p>
    <h2>Prague Modeling Agency</h2>
    <p>
        I also work with all the <b>major modeling agencies here in Prague</b>. I'm an agency approved photographer in this
        area. I've been getting killer shots for all the girls at these agencies for years. You can see my work on the cover
        of most of the girls at the major ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I started shooting for the agencies, I was mostly doing test work. Now I'm one of the photographers these agencies go
        to on a regular basis. Working with all the different modeling agencies, and their booking agents has me more in
        tune with what a booking agent is looking for. I can get you great shots that will be used for comp cards, headshots,
        or your entire book. It's taken me years to build up my relationships with the major modeling agencies in town, something
        that I really do enjoy doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I shoots on location and at a professional photography studio located in Downtown Prague.
